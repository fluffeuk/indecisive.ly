What's the purpose of life? Unfurl, I say. 

It's a nice word, unfurl is. Rolls off the tongue. As a student nearing the end of highschool, it describes exactly what I think I ought to do. Forget about expectations, forget about distractions, and focus on me. Figure myself out.

This blog is a chance to do just that. It's a place I can keep coming back to to record my thoughts. Hopefully, over a course of a few months, blog posts will compound into better writing. Over the course of a few years, they might compound into maturity, and maybe in a few decades, I'll have a library's worth of posts I can come back to at any moment. 

I could, of course, write this on paper. Time and time again, science (or _fake science_, depending on your views on cognitive psychology) has proven that writing by hand has numerous benefits. Still, given the modern day and age, convenience is not one of these benefits—it stands that it is much easier and faster (especially as someone who has spent a considerable amount of time on [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com)) to write and improve this blog with a computer. Trends in digitalisation also suggest that older me might find it easier to search for old posts in whatever futuristic gizmo I have handy (laptops and phones might be outdated, perhaps a hologram?) than to rummage through a pile of notebooks, though there is a beauty about words on a page that a blog like this one will never quite capture. 

What will I talk about? Well, I don't want to box myself in here. Honestly, anything. Another reason for choosing to make an online blog rather than a paper-based, private zettelkasten is the added value of my thoughts being accessible to anyone that might find them interesting. I'm going to write about whatever I feel like writing about, and I'm going to make it public with this blog so that if what I feel like writing about is what someone else feels like reading about, that someone has the chance to read about it. As you might be able to tell, if you're here for conciseness, now's the time to leave. 

Now, 'anything' isn't greatly specific. I'll give some hints, but the truth is that I don't know. My posts might be related to, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Books
2. Pseudo-philosophical crap
3. Interesting stuff I've learned
4. Opinions I have

Still not greatly specific. The truth is, I myself don't know what I want to write about. Again, no boxing myself in. Instead, _unfurl_. In writing about anything and everything, I'll discover a whole lot more about myself—and you, the reader, will _not_ discover anything about me, I hope (stay out of my business), but rather also discover things about yourself and perhaps spend hours upon hours deep in introspection after reading one of my well-thought, beautifully written, digestible, linear and completely understandable posts. 

If you've made it this far, I think you'll have made your mind up as to whether you want to chuck this darned site in a blocklist or maybe come back to it every now and then for the heck of it. I'm repetitive, I'm probably a little annoying, I don't make too much sense, and I'm all of these things with confidence and far too little modesty. 

If you don't mind these things, maybe we're more alike than you think. Come along and unfurl.
